## Model Information

The application uses the `tiny` model from faster-whisper, which provides a good balance between speed and accuracy. The model runs entirely on CPU, making it suitable for deployment on most platforms without requiring GPU resources.

## Notes

- The application uses CPU-based inference, which is suitable for most deployment scenarios
- Larger audio files will take longer to process
- For better accuracy, you can modify the model size in the code (options: tiny, base, small, medium, large)
